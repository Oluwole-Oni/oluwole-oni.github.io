## 👋 Welcome

I’m a **Data Analyst with a Mechanical Engineering background**, bringing a structured, analytical mindset to data-driven decision-making. My journey from engineering and automotive diagnostics into analytics allows me to approach data problems with precision, curiosity, and a strong focus on real-world impact.

I specialize in **SQL, Python, Tableau, Excel, and Power BI**, working across the full analytics lifecycle—from data cleaning and validation to insight generation and storytelling. I don’t just analyze numbers; I focus on **why patterns exist, what they mean for the business, and how insights can drive smarter decisions**.
