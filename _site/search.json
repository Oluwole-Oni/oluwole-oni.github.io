    "text": "I am a Data Analyst with a foundation in Mechanical Engineering, holding a Bachelor of Engineering degree and an Automotive Master Certificate from the Community College of Baltimore County. Over the years, I worked extensively with diagnostic data, performance metrics, and system troubleshooting, experiences that shaped my analytical thinking and attention to detail.\nMy transition into data analytics was driven by a growing interest in how data patterns, trends, and visualizations can influence strategic decisions. Through the CareerFoundry Data Analytics program, I gained hands-on experience delivering end-to-end analytics projects using Python, SQL, Tableau, Excel, and Power BI.\nWhat sets me apart is the combination of engineering discipline and data storytelling. I’m comfortable working with complex datasets and equally comfortable translating insights for non-technical stakeholders. My goal is always to connect analysis to business value, operational efficiency, and informed decision-making.\nI am currently open to full-time Data Analyst opportunities and enjoy collaborating with teams that value clarity, evidence-based strategy, and continuous improvement.\n\n\n\n\nMechanical Engineering mindset applied to analytics problem-solving\n\nEnd-to-end projects: cleaning → EDA → insights → dashboards → recommendations\n\nStrong communication for technical and non-technical stakeholders"
